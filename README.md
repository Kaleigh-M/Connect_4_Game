### Connect_4_Game
This is a simple Connect 4 game built using Python and Pygame. The game is designed for two players who take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. 
The first player to align four of their discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

# Features

  Two-Player Mode: Red represents Player 1, and Yellow represents Player 2.
  
  Interactive Gameplay: Players can hover their mouse over the top of the grid to see where their disc will drop.
  
  Win Detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won by aligning four discs in a row.
  
  Draw Detection: If all columns are filled and no player has aligned four discs, the game ends in a draw.

# How to Play

  Start the Game: Run the game using Python. The game window will open, displaying the Connect 4 grid.
  
  Turn-Based Gameplay: Player 1 (Red) starts first. Move the mouse to position your disc and click to drop it into the desired column.
  
  Winning the Game: Align four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to win. The game will announce the winner and end automatically.
  
  Draw: If the grid is completely filled without any player aligning four discs, the game will end in a draw.
